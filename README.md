# Clipping Assisant

Clipping Assistant is a tool to help clippers create YouTube clips of long videos, such as livestreams. 

It provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to specify snippets of a video to download with the desired audio/video format.

## Roadmap:

### Basic Functionalities:
* As a user, be able to select the video format, audio format and interval of a video per snippet.
* As a user, be able to download multiple snippets concurrently.
* As a user, be able to add a snippet to the list of snippet to download.
* As a user, be able to download a snippet.
* As a user, be able to merge video and audio snippets into one video+audio (e.g. `mp4`) snippet.

### QoL Functionalities:
* As a user, be able to select the video format, audio format and interval of a snippet via a interactive web interface.
* As a user, be able to generate a transcript of a merged snippet or audio snippet in English, Chinese, Korean or Japanese.
* As a user, be able to generate a transcript with speaker identification (Speaker Diarization).
* As a user, be able to specify the interval of a snippet by dragging a slider on the video player via a web interface.

### In The Future:
* Localization of CLI & web-UI to Japanese and Chinese.
* Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) correction for transcripts generated in Japanese, with domain-specific knowledge on video games and VTubers.
